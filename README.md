mad-x\_syntax
=============

### MAD-X syntax highlighting for emacs.  
Check the `madx.el' file header for installation instructions.


### FEATURES (v 1.5)

* Edited to be compatible with emacs ELPA repository
* Highlights commands, parameters and special operators in MAD-X 5.X.X
* If the file extension is '.madx' then the buffer is automatically highlighted,  
  but any buffer can be highlighted by doing :  
    `M+X madx-mode`  
  where `M` is the **META** character in Emacs (`M` seems to be **ALT** in Linux)
* If the limit of 80 characters is desired, they could be highlighted differently
  by uncomment the line in this (`madx.el') file.
  
```lisp
(require 'whitespace)
(setq whitespace-line-column 80) ;; limit line length
(setq whitespace-style '(face lines-tail))
(add-hook 'madx-mode-hook 'whitespace-mode)
```

### TODO

I think a semicolon detection at the end of the line might be useful in madx. 
Maybe autocompletion??

   emacs, KATE+KWRITE, VIM

mad-x\_syntax
=============

### MAD-X syntax highlighting for emacs.  
The main file is called 'madx.el' and is found in the 'emacs' folder. Download it, open it in emacs and type the expression
```lisp
 M+X package-install-file RET madx.el RET
```
[where `M+X` means to to press the **META** key (i.e. **ALT** for most systems) and the `x` key at the same time, and `RET` means to press the **RETURN** key]. Otherwise, check the
file header for installation instructions.


### FEATURES (v 1.9)

* Edited to be compatible with emacs ELPA repository
* Highlights commands, parameters and special operators in MAD-X 5.05.02
* If the file extension is '.madx' or '.seq' then the buffer is automatically 
  highlighted, but any buffer can be highlighted by doing :  
    `M+X madx-mode`  
  where `M` is the **META** character in Emacs (`M` seems to be **ALT** in Linux)
* If the limit of 80 characters is desired, they could be highlighted differently
  by uncomment the line in this (`madx.el') file.
  
```lisp
(require 'whitespace)
(setq whitespace-line-column 80) ;; limit line length
(setq whitespace-style '(face lines-tail))
(add-hook 'madx-mode-hook 'whitespace-mode)
```

I think a semicolon detection at the end of the line might be useful in madx. 
Maybe autocompletion??
